Supplementary Tables with additional information not in the main manuscript (e.g., exact p-values, confidence intervals) can be found in the links below. 

The codebase is generally structured so that analyses that take along time are run using R scripts and the results of those analyses are saved. Extraction of the results and the creation of tables and plots is then done in quarto (.qmd) scripts. Below, tables and figures from those quarto scripts (or generated by those quarto scripts) are linked to below. 

Please note that the way the research questions are labeled in the codebase differs to how they are presented in the paper.
